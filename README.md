## PUBG Cheat

Welcome to the **PUBG Cheat with Aimbot Menu**, a high-fidelity visual replica of the most common cheating tools found in PUBG, including **Aimbot**, **ESP**, **Wallhack**, **Radar**, and **No Recoil** modules. This is a **functional**, **ethical**, and **educational project** meant to give insight into how cheating software is structured — without modifying any game files or violating terms of service.

---

## Overview

* Study cheat mechanics and layout
* Develop detection algorithms
* Train security and ethical hacking students
* Create mockups for countermeasure tools

---

## PUBG Aimbot

The Aimbot module mimics one of the most widely used cheats in PUBG. This simulation includes UI options typically found in advanced aimbot programs:

* **FOV Circle Adjuster** – Simulate the aiming cone with customizable radius.
* **Target Bone Selector** – Choose which bone to lock on (head, chest, torso).
* **Smooth Aim Sliders** – Mimic natural movements by adjusting aim response speed.
* **Aim Key Binding** – Assign hotkeys to activate simulated aim assist.
* **Visibility Checks** – Simulate logic for only targeting visible enemies.

Aimbots are notorious for providing precise target tracking and locking onto enemies, but many modern versions also add human-like randomness to avoid detection. In this simulator, you can explore all interface elements typically used to control these cheats — perfect for developers building defense systems or those training to identify suspicious gameplay patterns. The goal is to create a realistic interface that allows in-depth study without ever modifying game memory.

## PUBG ESP Interface

ESP (Extrasensory Perception) reveals player and item data in ways not accessible by normal gameplay. This simulator includes ESP features commonly found in underground cheat menus:

* **Player Name & Health** – Display enemy names and remaining HP.
* **Box ESP** – Draw 2D/3D boxes around enemies.
* **Snaplines** – Lines drawn from screen center to enemy targets.
* **Item ESP** – Highlight weapons, ammo, and equipment.
* **Distance Markers** – Show how far entities are from the player.

The ESP interface gives players an overwhelming advantage by revealing hidden data. This replica allows UI/UX designers, anti-cheat teams, and educators to study how cheaters use visual overlays to manipulate play. Features can be turned on/off and simulated on a preview canvas, helping engineers understand visual clutter, range thresholds, and how ESP data layers are commonly grouped.

## PUBG Wallhack

Wallhacks allow cheaters to see opponents through solid surfaces. This module simulates:

* **Enemy X-ray View** – Transparent render simulation for occluded targets.
* **Surface Highlights** – Color-coding for walls or doors between players and enemies.
* **Threat Level Display** – Visual markers for enemies with high-tier gear.
* **Toggle Zones** – Enable wallhack visuals within certain map regions.

Wallhacks are one of the most disruptive cheat categories because they negate tactical movement and stealth. Our interface emulates how options for opacity, hitbox visibility, and depth simulation are presented to users. Developers working on occlusion-based anti-cheat methods can test interface logic, simulate scenarios, and demonstrate vulnerabilities without accessing game files. This visualization tool is ideal for ethical hacking labs or UX training modules focused on illegal software.

---

## PUBG Radar

Radar hacks replicate mini-maps showing enemy/player positions across the entire map — even outside of normal view. The simulator mimics:

* **2D/3D Radar Widgets** – With zoom, rotation, and static view options.
* **Live Enemy Icons** – Represent players in real-time on a custom map.
* **Loot Radar** – Show nearby weapons, armor, and supply drops.
* **Team Differentiation** – Icon color schemes for enemy, ally, or AI bots.

The Radar UI is one of the most discreet and undetectable forms of cheating, making it a vital area of study for game security teams. With this interface, you can replicate conditions in which radar software would be used and explore how location data might be displayed. Adjust distance scale, signal intensity, and icon behavior without ever interacting with game code. This tool is a safe testing space for anti-radar strategies.

---

## PUBG No Recoil

The No Recoil interface showcases how some cheats manipulate recoil patterns to maintain full-auto accuracy. The simulator includes:

* **Recoil Curve Graphs** – Preview of visualized recoil paths.
* **Suppression Toggles** – Enable per-weapon or global recoil elimination.
* **Compensation Speed Sliders** – Control how fast the system resets crosshair position.
* **Weapon Profiles** – Save/load simulated settings for AKM, M416, UMP45, etc.

Recoil hacks provide zero kickback, drastically improving performance in gunfights. In our simulated UI, these cheats are displayed exactly as in real-world tools — down to recoil dampening percentages and weapon-specific overrides. Researchers can use this to develop behavioral detection, simulate recoil pattern anomalies, and explore training applications around cheat visibility.

## 📚 Use Cases

* 🔬 **Anti-Cheat Research**: Build and test detection algorithms.
* 🎓 **Academic Education**: Train students on ethical software design.
* 🎮 **Game Design Analysis**: Understand how users misuse visual tools.
* 🛠️ **Security UX Evaluation**: Discover how malicious UIs are structured.

## 🛑 Legal & Ethical Notice

This simulator is **100% safe** and performs **no game interaction**. It is **not a real cheat** and never injects or modifies memory. We do **not condone cheating** in any online game and encourage developers to use this for educational and professional purposes only.

Use of real cheats violates PUBG’s Terms of Service and will result in permanent bans. This project is for white-hat study, awareness, and ethical development only.
